Algorithm:

1.Start with the first number in the array.

2.Go through each number after it.

3.Add the two numbers.

4.If the sum equals the target, return their positions (indexes).

5.If not, continue checking.

6.If you reach the end without finding a match, say "no pair found".



Pseudocode:

for i from 0 to n-1:
    for j from i+1 to n-1:
        if arr[i] + arr[j] == target:
            return i, j


C Code:

#include <stdio.h>

void twoSum(int arr[], int n, int target) {
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for(int j = i+1; j < n; j++) {
            if(arr[i] + arr[j] == target) {
                printf("Indices: %d and %d\n", i, j);
                return;
            }
        }
    }
    printf("No two sum solution found\n");
}
